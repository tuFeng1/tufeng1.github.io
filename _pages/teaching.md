ISE 3200: Linear Programming and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming

Instructor: [Prof. Antonio J. Conejo](https://u.osu.edu/conejo.1)

Course Slides: [Here](https://u.osu.edu/conejo.1/courses/lp-milp/)

In this course, we will show that linear programming (LP) problems are important for the industry, and explain how to formulate such problems, how to solve them, and how to interpret the results. We will do likewise with mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems.

After successfully completing this course, you will be capable of analyzing relevant industry problems by formulating them as LP or MILP problems, solving them, and interpreting the results obtained.
