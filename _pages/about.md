Hello!

I am a 3-rd year Ph.D. student in Integrated Systems Engineering (Operations Research). I received dual-degrees in Industrial Engineering in 2021 from Sichuan University (China) and The Ohio State University. My research interests lie in math modeling and optimization applied to the electricity market and cybersecurity.

Advisor: [Dr. Antonio Conejo](https://u.osu.edu/conejo.1/), Professor, Integrated System Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering.

Co-advisor: Dr. Theodore Allen, Professor, Integrated Systems Engineering. [Security & Efficiency Analytics Laboratory](https://blying.com/).

I am also the president of [INFORMS Student Chapter @ Ohio State](https://u.osu.edu/informsosu/)
and a delegate of Integrated Systems Engineering in [Council of Graduate Students](https://cgs.osu.edu/).
